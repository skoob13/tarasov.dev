You want to add a light/dark theme to your Astro project with Tailwind? It's quite easy and all you need is a plain Javascript script. I will describe a Tailwind's theming approach through a class, but you can adjust the code for other use cases too.

## Apply theme without FOUC

[Flash of Unstyled Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) is a common problem in theming. Sometimes you can see how the default theme applies firsly, usually a light theme, switching to a dark theme, blinking, and making the UI to look ugly for a moment. In Astro, you can implement a script in `<head>` which checks, if the theme has been applied previously. This website applies this script in the main layout.

```astro
---
---
<html class="dark">
  <head>
    <script>
      if (
        localStorage.theme === 'dark' ||
        (!('theme' in localStorage) && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)
      ) {
        document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
      } else {
        document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Since Astro transpiles scripts that you put in `script` tags, we won't be bothered by checking [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com).

## Implement a theme switcher button

Next, we're going to implement a button for switching themes. As you may guess you only need to save a newly selected theme to a local storage and switch the class of the `<html>` element.

```astro
---
---
<button type="button" id="theme-selector">
  <span class="sr-only">Enable <span class="dark:hidden">light</span><span class="hidden dark:inline">dark</span> mode</span>
  <svg class="hidden dark:inline">
    <-- dark icon -->
  <svg class="dark:hidden">
    <-- light icon -->
  </svg>
</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById('theme-selector')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (localStorage.theme === 'dark') {
      localStorage.theme = 'light';
      document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
    } else {
      localStorage.theme = 'dark';
      document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
    }
  });
</script>
```

If you want to modify UI to show a block in the light mode only use this class:
```html
<span class="dark:hidden"></span>
```

And vice-versa, if you want to show an element only in the dark mode use this class:
```html
<span class="hidden dark:inline"></span>
```

That's it! Check [the source code](https://github.com/skoob13/tarasov.dev) of my website to see implementation. If you want to see it in action, just switch a theme.
