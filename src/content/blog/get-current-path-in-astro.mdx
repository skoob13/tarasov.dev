If you have a background in Next.js, you will probably want an alternative API to `router.asPath`. However, Astro doesn't really have a router, but it provides a similar API. To get a current page's pathname use the Astro's built-in global module `Astro.url`:

```javascript
const asPath = Astro.url.pathname;
```

### Bonus: building a canonical URL of a page in Astro

In your `astro.config.mjs` set a base URL of your website, which will be set as an environment variable in `import.meta.env.SITE`:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://tarasov.dev',
});
```

Then you can use `Astro.url.pathname` in combination with `import.meta.env.SITE`:

```javascript
const canonicalUrl = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, import.meta.env.SITE).href;
```

For this page the code above evaluates to:
